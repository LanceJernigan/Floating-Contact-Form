# Floating-Contact-Form
A floating contact form plugin for Wordpress

The plugin is definitely missing a lot of functionality right now.  It was built with expandability in mind...just without having the time right now to expand it.  Any text changes will have to be made in /assets/js/index.js.  Find the correlating line and simply change the text.

The plugin can be customized a decent amount right now, but most of the customization require directly editing files.  If that's your thing, be my guest.  If not, maybe one day I'll have some time to finish building this thing out.

Things I want to add if my schedule ever meets my ambitions:

  1.  Ajax form submission
  2.  Customization of contact fields
  3.  Custom email (currently uses the site admin email)
  4.  Custom description before form (currently hardcoded into /assets/js/index.js)
